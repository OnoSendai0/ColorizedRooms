# ColorizedRooms
 a programming exercise


A floor plan is an abstract representation of a building floor and defined by the distribution of walls and space.  For this project, floor plans are represented by ASCII characters, with walls being “#” and empty spaces being “ “ (white space). 

 - A room is defined by a cluster of adjacent spaces surrounded by walls and doors.

 - A door is defined by a single space that divides two collinear walls.

 - Make the rooms easily distinguishable from each other by using colors.

 - Write a simple piece of software that receives an ASCII floor plan and prints a nice, beautiful and colorful rendering of the floor plan with the rooms colorized.

Consider:

 - All spaces are reachable.
 - Edge cases you can ignore:
 - Rooms 1 space wide (for example, narrow hallways).
 - Use any programming language you like.
 - Use your creativity for color choice and rendering style.
 - Spend no more than 1 hour.
 - BONUS: feeling bored? Have nothing more interesting to do?
    - Adjacent rooms cannot have the same color. Adjacent rooms are defined by rooms sharing the same wall or door.
    - Use the minimum number of colors.
